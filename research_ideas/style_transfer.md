# A summary on the state-of-art methods: 
* The first method: a neural style transfer algorithm(based on optimization)
* Then 

# Some Thoughts
* The loss function: perceptual loss and content loss (now all use the loss function in the first paper) (how about new loss function? )
* Improve the feed-forward network (pooling layers / deconvolution layers -> decoder net / I-to-I layer)
  (new structures for the network)
* A new net for multiple styles ()
* How to apply reinforcement learning to this task
