# Information 
* Paper: [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155v1.pdf)
* Author: Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei
* Implementation: [torch](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style), [tensorflow](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)

# Summary 
* what:
  * Combining the advantages of feed-forward NN (per-pixel loss) method and optimization-based method (perceptual loss) method. Their network can get a comparable result to optimization-based method in real-time.
* how: 
  * Two basic components: image transformation network and loss network 
  * Image transformation networksï¼š follow the architectural guidelines of DCGAN 
    * For style transfer: 
  *
