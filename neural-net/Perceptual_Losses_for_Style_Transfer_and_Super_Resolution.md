# Information 
* Paper: [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155v1.pdf)
* Author: Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei
* Implementation: [torch](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style), [tensorflow](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)

# Summary 
# what: #
Combining the advantages of feed-forward NN (per-pixel loss) method and optimizing (perceptual loss) method. Their network can get a comparable result to optimization-based method in real-time.
# how: #
* Two basic components: image transformation network and loss network
